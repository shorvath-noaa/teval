def build_nexus_crosswalk(
    gdf_hydro: Optional[gpd.GeoDataFrame],
) -> Dict[int, List[int]]:
    """
    Map each nexus to the feature ids draining to it.

    Ensemble weights are supplied per nexus while the ensemble dataset is
    indexed by ``feature_id``, so applying them needs this crosswalk.  The
    relationship is many-to-one: every flowpath at a confluence drains to the
    same nexus and therefore shares its weights.

    The mapping is derived entirely from the ``toid`` column of the flowpaths
    frame that has already been loaded, so this reads no file and adds no
    GeoPackage access to a run.

    Nexus keys come from ``toid`` and feature ids from the frame's index, and
    the two are never crossed; both are reduced by
    :func:`teval.identifiers.as_identifiers`, whose docstring gives the reason
    for each.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gdf_hydro:
        Flowpaths frame as ``load_hydrofabric`` returns it: indexed by integer
        feature id with a ``toid`` column naming the downstream nexus.  ``None``
        or an empty frame means no hydrofabric was configured for this domain.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[int, list[int]]
        Nexus id to the feature ids draining to it, both as plain integers.
        Nexus keys follow first appearance in the frame and each list follows
        frame order, so the result is deterministic.  A nexus appears only if
        at least one flowpath drains to it.  An absent or empty hydrofabric
        gives an empty dict, which resolves to no coverage rather than to an
        error — the caller decides whether missing weights matter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        A non-empty frame has no ``toid`` column, an identifier column holds a
        non-integral value, or a feature id is missing.

    Notes
    -----
    Flowpaths whose ``toid`` is missing are dropped with a warning: they cannot
    be placed at a nexus, and they surface downstream as uncovered features
    under the weight coverage policy.  A feature that drains to two different
    nexuses is left in both groups for the resolver to reject, so that rule
    lives in one place.
