"""
Tests for the ordering of the loading steps in ``load_domain_data``.

``load_domain_data`` performs three loads, and the order among them is a
contract rather than an accident:

* the hydrofabric depends on nothing but ``domain_dict['hydrofabric']``, and
  must come first because the nexus-to-feature crosswalk it yields is what a
  weighted run needs *before* the ensemble stats graph is built;
* the formulations come second, since that is where the graph is built;
* the observations come last, because their fetch window is derived from the
  time bounds the formulation files report.

Only the first two moved.  These tests pin the order, pin the one real
dependency that forces observations to stay last, and assert that reordering
changed no result — both against a transcription of the previous
implementation and against a real end-to-end unweighted load.

The transcription tracks the previous *order*, not a frozen historical
signature: it forwards the weight-plan argument the later wiring work added to
``_process_formulation_files``, since a parameter that did not exist then
carries no ordering information now.  The wiring itself is covered separately,
in ``test_workflow_weights.py``.
