"""
Shared pytest fixtures for the teval test suite.

The fixtures here provide the small synthetic inputs the ensemble machinery
operates on: a combined dataset carrying a ``formulation`` dimension, a
minimal flowpaths frame in the shape ``load_hydrofabric`` returns, a tidy
weight frame in the provisional weight-file schema, and the same inputs
written to disk for the tests that drive ``load_domain_data`` end to end.

All values are chosen to be hand-checkable so tests can assert against
expectations worked out on paper rather than against a second implementation.
Everything describing the same synthetic domain lives here so the several
weighting test modules cannot drift apart on what that domain is; the plain
helper functions they share are in ``weighting_support.py``.
